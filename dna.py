A spy deleted important files from a computer. There were a few witnesses
at the scene of the crime, but no one is sure who exactly the spy was.
Three possible suspects were apprehended based on surveillance video. Each
suspect had a sample of DNA taken from them. The computer's keyboard was 
also swabbed for DNA evidence and, luckily, one small DNA sample was 
successfully retrieved from the computer's keyboard.

Given the three suspects' DNA and the sample DNA retreived from the keyboard,
it's up to you to figure out who the spy is!

The project should have methods for each of the following:

1) Given a file, read in the DNA for each suspect and save it as a string
2) Take a DNA string and split it into a list of codons
3) Iterate through a suspect's codon list to see how many of their codons
 match the sample codons
4) Pick the right suspect to continue the investigation on
